# Moon New Template

It is the template used for `moon new`. The actual layout is stored under
`moon_new_template`, and the corresponding metadata is stored in
`moon_new_template.toml`. When modifying it, use
`cargo run -p xtask bundle-template` to update the metadata, which is the one
that is actually used.
